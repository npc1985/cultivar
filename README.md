## 🌾 Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tools

### The Old Ways

Cultivar honors traditional agricultural practices that modern science increasingly validates:

**Lunar Planting** — The gravitational pull of the moon affects moisture in the soil. Plant root crops during the waning moon, leafy crops during the waxing moon.

**Companion Planting** — The Three Sisters (corn, beans, squash) have been grown together for over 5,000 years. Cultivar knows hundreds of such beneficial partnerships.

**Biodynamic Calendar** — Plant, cultivate, and harvest according to cosmic rhythms for more vital, nutritious crops.

**Succession Planting** — The homesteader's secret to continuous harvests from spring through fall.

**Seed Saving** — Preserve heirloom varieties and adapt plants to your specific growing conditions.

### The New Science

Modern horticulture enhances traditional methods:

- **Frost Prediction Algorithms** — Precise last/first frost dates for your exact location
